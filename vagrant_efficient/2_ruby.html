  <h1>Efficient Vagrantfiles – Part 2 – Vagrant is Ruby!</h1>

  <p>In the <a href="1_minimum.html">first part</a> of this series, I kept stating that Vagrant is Ruby. Let's see what's that for.</p>

  <h2>Problem - code repetition</h2>

  <p>Suppose you need a Vagrant environment with lots of virtual machines. Following the way of the first part - which I used when I started - you would need to repeat the same code for each VM. Example:</p>

  <pre>
  Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

    config.vm.define 'vm_1' do |vm|
      vm.vm.box = &lt;Box&gt;
      &lt;Settings&gt;
    end
    config.vm.define 'vm_2' do |vm|
      vm.vm.box = &lt;Box&gt;
      &lt;Settings&gt;
    end
    ...
    config.vm.define 'vm_N' do |vm|
      vm.vm.box = &lt;Box&gt;
      &lt;Settings&gt;
    end
  end
  </pre>

  <p>Code like this tends to get lengthy, and takes a lot of effort to create (copy-paste-edit-paste-edit...). It's also hard to mantain - you have to repeat the process for each VM you want to add. Besides, finding an error would be a pain...</p>

  <h2>Solution - variables, loops and conditionals</h2>

  <p>If you are a developer (and you likely are), you already notice a repeating pattern, with predictable variations in key spots, in the code above. Well, Ruby is a programming language, isn't it?</p>
  <p>Let's revisit some helpful Ruby concepts. This won't be a real class - just an overview of what we're about to use</p>
  <blockquote>We'll use <code>ruby -e</code> command, which runs Ruby code in the <i>shell</i></blockquote>

  <h3><i>Arrays</i> and <i>Hashes</i></h3>

  <p><i>Arrays</i> are sets of objects. Easy as this: a list containing some items. You should put them inside square brackets, separated by commas.</p>
  <p><i>Hashes</i> indexed sets. Each item has an index, called <b>key</b>, which ponts to a <b>value</b>. You should put them inside curly brackets, separated by commas.</p>

  <blockquote>We'll use <code>class</code> method, which returns the class from which the object is an instance</blockquote>

  <pre>
  $ ruby -e 'puts [-5, 3.14, "Text", :symbol].class'
  Array

  $ ruby -e 'puts ({1 => "b", "c" => 5.5, :something => "else"}.class)'
  Hash
  </pre>

  <p>Let's remind ourselves that, in Ruby, everything is an object. So the concept of <b>types</b> makes no sense. <code>Array</code> and <code>Hash</code> are <b>classes</b>.</p>
  <p>Also, <code>Arrays</code> and <code>Hashes</code> can be nested (I divided in multiple lines for a better view):</p>

  <pre>
  $ ruby -e 'puts [
    1,
    [2, 3, 4],
    {1 => "a"}
  ].class'
  Array

  $ ruby -e 'puts ({
    1 => [2, 3, 4],
    "c" => {1 => "a"},
    [1, 2] => "f",
    {1 => "a"} => 5
  }.class)'
  Hash
  </pre>

  <h3>The <code>each</code> loop</h3>

  <p>It's easy to create repetition loops in Ruby using method <code>each</code>. When iterating an <code>Array</code>, the loop repeats itself, with a variable which contains, in each execution, one array item. when iterating a <code>Hash</code>, we use one variable for the keys and another one for the values.</p>
  <p>The method is invoked with a syntax common in object-oriented languages: <code>&lt;Object&gt;.&lt;Method&gt;</code>, that is, <code>&lt;Array/Hash&gt;.each</code>. The <code>each</code> method syntax is:</p>

  <pre>
  &lt;Object&gt;.each do |&lt;variável(is)&gt;|
    &lt;Bloco utilizando a(s) variável(is)&gt;
  end
  </pre>

  <p>Showing an <code>Array</code> and a <code>Hash</code> iterations:</p>

  <pre>$ ruby -e '
  [1, 2, 3].each do |var|
    puts var
  end
  '
  1
  2
  3

  $ ruby -e '
  {1 => "a", 2 => "b", 3 => "c"}.each do |key, value|
    puts "Key: #{key} - Value: #{value}"
  end
  '
  Key: 1 - Value: a
  Key: 2 - Value: b
  Key: 3 - Value: c
  </pre>

  <h3>Conditionals</h3>

  <p>Conditionals are the same thing in every language: a code block is executed if a set of conditions is met. In Ruby, the conditional statements are <code>if</code>, <code>elsif</code>, <code>else</code> and <code>unless</code>:</p>

  <pre>$ ruby -e '
  puts "Digite a idade"
  age = gets().to_i
  unless age < 0 then
    if age >= 18 then
      puts "Adulto"
    elsif age >= 12
      puts "Adolescente"
    else
      puts "Criança"
    end
  else
    puts "?"
  end
  '
  </pre>

      'vm_3' => {
        :box => 'centos/7',
        :ip => '192.168.1.4'
      }
    }.each do |name, confs|
      config.vm.define name do |vm|
        vm.vm.box = confs[:box]
        vm.vm.network "private_network", ip: confs[:ip]
      end
    end
  end
  </pre>
